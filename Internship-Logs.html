            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
                I completed half of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org"><u style="color: blue;">"Git and
                GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course."</u></a> From this, I learned the difference between Git and GitHub, along with 
                Git commands such as "git push", "git add", "git commit" and "git clone." Additionally, I learned the basically 
                terminologies used when working with Git and GitHub. As well, I learned about SSH keys and learned to generate my
                own for my GitHub account. The only thing I would do differently is to clone with HTTPS rather than SSH.

                    I completed the other half of the

                    This went smoother than yesterday as through research and trying out various cloning methods, HTTPS 
                    was easier to clone with as it caused less errors compared to SSH. Once I finished the crash course. I watch a 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k&ab_channel=TheNetNinja"><u style="color: blue;">YouTube video</u></a> about GitHub pages and 
                    how to host my own. I was successfully able to host my own <a href="https://fabienthich.github.io"><u style="color: blue;">website</u></a>
                    as seen on the left. I have made some improvements to the website and I am currently working on pushing it out and updating
                    it.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
                    I followed along a 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified"><u style="color: blue;">React Tutorial.</u></a> 
                    This tutorial does not cover the complex concepts of React but does cover the basics of React. I did not get to finish the
                    tutorial, however, I did follow alongside. The tutorial demonstrated how to create a To-Do List using React as well as using 
                    npm and npx commands. The photo on the left shows a To-Do List that displays tasks in the console that the user typed into
                    the textbox. As well, I successfully changed my default website page from my README.md file to 
                    <a href="index.html"><u style="color: blue;">Home.</u></a>

                <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
                    I developed a clicking app, or a simpler version of Cookie Clicker through a 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eMGE7QtTk&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery"><u style="color: blue;">Crash Course.</u></a> 
                    This tutorial involves the uses of "Props" and "Hooks" such as "useStates." This clicking app does not only let to add by one,
                    but allows you to subtract by one as well. After finishing this tutorial, I gained a better understanding of React's format. 
                    To further familiarize myself with React, I started another tutorial, 
                    "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGcsHMXbSOA&ab_channel=developedbyed"><u style="color: blue;">React Tutorial For Beginners</u></a>"
                    which puts more emphasis on the concepts and structures.
