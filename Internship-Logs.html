            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                I completed half of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org">"Git and
                GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course."</a> From this, I learned the difference between Git and GitHub, along with 
                Git commands such as "git push", "git add", "git commit" and "git clone." Additionally, I learned the basically 
                terminologies used when working with Git and GitHub. As well, I learned about SSH keys and learned to generate my
                own for my GitHub account. The only thing I would do differently is to clone with HTTPS rather than SSH.

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    I completed the other half of the
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org">Crash Course.</a>
                    This went smoother than yesterday as through research and trying out various cloning methods, HTTPS 
                    was easier to clone with as it caused less errors compared to SSH. Once I finished the crash course. I watch a 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k&ab_channel=TheNetNinja">YouTube video</a> about GitHub pages and 
                    how to host my own. I was successfully able to host my own <a href="https://fabienthich.github.io/website/">website</a>
                    as seen on the left. I have made some improvements to the website and I am currently working on pushing it out and updating
                    it.<br>
