            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
                I completed half of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org" target="_blank"><u style="color: blue;">"Git and
                GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course."</u></a> From this, I learned the difference between Git and GitHub, along with 
                Git commands such as "git push", "git add", "git commit" and "git clone." Additionally, I learned the basic 
                terminologies used when working with Git and GitHub. As well, I learned about SSH keys and learned to generate my
                own for my GitHub account. The only thing I would do differently is to clone with HTTPS rather than SSH.

                    This went smoother than yesterday as through research and trying out various cloning methods, HTTPS 
                    was easier to clone with as it caused less errors compared to SSH. Once I finished the crash course. I watched a

                    This tutorial does not cover the complex concepts of React but does cover the basics of React. I did not get to finish the
                    tutorial, however, I did follow alongside. The tutorial demonstrated how to create a To-Do List using React as well as using 
                    npm and npx commands. The photo on the left shows a To-Do List that displays tasks in the console that the user typed into

                    This tutorial involves the uses of "Props" and "Hooks" such as "useStates." This clicking app does not only let to add by one,
                    but allows you to subtract by one as well. After finishing this tutorial, I gained a better understanding of React's format. 
                    To further familiarize myself with React, I started another tutorial,

                <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
                    I began the process of rewriting my website using React. During this process, I created a <b><i>component</i></b> folder under my <b><i>src</i></b> folder
                    which included Javascript contents for the header and body of the website. The React website to the left is identical to the website from 
                    September 27, 2022 (Hosting a Website). The only difference is that this websites navigation bar is still in the works and the "styles"
                    for the Internship-Logs content needs to be converted into React format. I am working to solve these issues to create an exact replica.

                    I started off the day of picking it up from where I left off. I successfully converted all of my <i>Internship-Logs</i> content into React format.
                    As well I spent some time trying to resolve issues relating to React Routers and Switches. Unfortunately, I had no success but I got a lead from my 
                    mentor. Soon after, I had a meeting with my mentor to which he taught me windows shortcuts, which are essential to becoming a great software engineer.
                    From this, I was able to navigate around my computer more effectively and efficiently without a mouse. Click image for

                <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
                    I found a solution to the Switch error I had mentioned previously. Through research, I learned that <b>Routes</b> served the same purpose as <b>Switch</b>. 
                    After trial and error, I was successfully able to replace the use of Switches with Routes by importing <b>Routes</b> from <b>'react-router-dom'</b>. Additionally, I researched Route Paths to which 
                    I learned the concept of capitalizing the first letter when assigning the JavaScript file to an element; capitalizing the first letter would render the 
                    JavaScript file individually.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
                    My mentor advised me to take notice of processes I find myself constantly doing that take up time to-which I could have spent being more productive such as coding, 
                    debugging, researching etc… To my surprise, I found myself constantly using the same inline styling for my internship logs. This essentially led me to
                    create CSS classes which I could reuse for future logs. As well, I figured out a solution to my text alignment and font size errors which originated 
                    from incorrect slash placements in tags when converting HTML to JSX.
